# Compatibility

macOS hardware support is limited to what hardware Apple supports and community-created patches.

## CPU support

`AMD Bulldozer (15h)` and newer CPUs are supported with the [AMD Vanilla](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla){target="_blank"} patches.

::alert{type="warning"}
:icon{name="IconWarning"} The patches support only `macOS 10.13` and newer, older versions require a custom Kernel. This is unsupported by this guide.
::

::alert{type="info"}
:icon{name="IconInfo"} AMD Laptop CPUs are the same as AMD Desktop CPUs
::

::alert{type="danger"}
:icon{name="IconError"} A few things in macOS don't work properly with an AMD CPU, see [below](#amd-cpu-incompatibilities)
::

### CPU requirements

#### Architecture requirements

::list{type="info"}
- x86_64/AMD64 (64-bit) CPUs are supported since Mac OS X 10.4.1
::

#### SSE requirements

::list{type="info"}
- `SSE3` is required for all Intel versions of macOS
- `SSSE3` is required for all 64-bit versions of macOS
::
::list{type="warning"}
- `SSE4` is required for `macOS 10.12` up to, not including, `macOS 10.14`
- `SSE4.2` is required for `macOS 10.14`+ and newer AMD GPU drivers. Avoid `SSE4.1`-only CPUs if possible. May work with some hacks; see [Gathering Files > Kexts](/guide/gathering-files/kexts)
::

### AMD CPU incompatibilities

Unfortunately some things in macOS are broken with AMD.

#### Virtual Machines that utilise AppleHV

Examples include:

::list{type="danger"}
- `VirtualBox` version >`6`
- `VMWare` version >`10`
- `Parallels` version >`13.1`
- `Docker`
- `Android Studio`
::

::alert{type="info"}
:icon{name="IconInfo"} Older `VirtualBox`, `VMware`, and `Parallels` versions than the ones AppleHV usage was introduced in do use own hypervisor, but outdated VM are likely large security threats, amongst other issues.
::

#### Compatibility issues with some apps

Apps utilising Intel MKL will require a patch with a tool such as `AMDFriend`.

Some examples include:

- Krisp
- Logic Pro Waves Plug-In
- Adobe software

In addition, the `AMD Vanilla` patches don't support 32-bit apps running in `WINE`, including `CrossOver`. However, it somehow works on Threadripper (TRX40).

## GPU support

GPU support is highly complicated due to the amount of graphics cards.

### AMD GPUs

::list{type="success"}
- [GCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Core_Next){target="_blank"} and [RDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_(microarchitecture)){target="_blank"} GPUs are supported in the latest versions of macOS.
::
::list{type="danger"}
- RDNA 3 GPUs are unsupported.
::
::list{type="success"}
- [Raven-based](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-raven.g816){target="_blank"} (Ryzen 3000 series and older, GCN 5, aka Vega10) and [Renoir-based](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-renoir.g1058){target="_blank"} (Ryzen 4000 series and newer, GCN 5.1, aka Vega20) AMD APUs are supported with **NootedRed**; see [Gathering Files > Kexts](/guide/gathering-files/kexts). **Works from `macOS 11` up to `macOS 14`. `macOS 10.15` in progress.**
::
::list{type="danger"}
- Other iGPU generations (GCN <5, RDNA) are **not supported at all yet**.
::
::list{type="warning"}
- [Lexa-based](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-lexa.g806){target="_blank"} (GCN 4, aka Polaris) are supported with a **device ID spoof**.
::

Special note for **MSI Navi** users: [Installer not working with 5700XT #901](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/901){target="_blank"}, **resolved since `macOS 11`**.

### NVIDIA GPUs

::list{type="warning"}
- Maxwell ([9XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_900_series){target="_blank"}) and Pascal ([10XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_10_series){target="_blank"}) GPUs are **limited** to **`macOS 10.13`**.
::
::list{type="danger"}
- Turing ([20XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_20_series){target="_blank"}, [16XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_16_series){target="_blank"}) GPUs are **not** supported in any version of macOS.
- Ampere ([30XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_30_series){target="_blank"}) GPUs are **not** supported in any version of macOS.
::
::list{type="warning"}
- Kepler ([6XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_600_series){target="_blank"}, [7XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_700_series){target="_blank"}) GPUs are supported up to **`macOS 11`**.

With that out of the way, let's start with [gathering the required files](/guide/gathering-files).
