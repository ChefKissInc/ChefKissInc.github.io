# ACPI

::alert{type="info"}
:icon{name="Info"} `Advanced Configuration and Power Interface` (ACPI) is an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components, perform power management (e.g. putting unused hardware components to sleep), auto configuration (e.g. Plug and Play and hot swapping), and status monitoring.
::

Why do we care about ACPI?

For starters, a lot of manufacturers gate some devices like the I2C controller, the GPIO controller, FN keys functionality, amongst others behind checks for operating systems like Windows.

The main ACPI table in a system is the `DSDT` (Differentiated System Description Table), which defines most of the devices. Then there are the `SSDT`s (Secondary System Description Tables), which add extra properties (for example, the `_PRW` (Power Resources for Wake) method), extra devices, disable some devices based on a condition, etc.

Most firmware define the devices in the `DSDT` and use some `SSDT`s to adjust values depending on the installed hardware and/or BIOS settings. If you're interested in ACPI, you can learn more by reading the [ACPI Specification](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ACPI_Spec_6_5_Aug29.pdf){target="_blank"}.

In the past, these SSDTs had to be written manually, but now we have automated tools that do this process. We will use [`SSDTTime`](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime){target="_blank"}.

::alert{type="warning"}
:icon{name="Warning"} This process has to be done on the computer that macOS will be installed on, or by dumping the `DSDT` from the target system and selecting it instead of pressing `P` later.
::

Since `SSDTTime` does not have any releases and it's a Python project, we will download the source code instead by clicking on `Code > Download Zip`.

![SSDTTime download page](/Images/SSDTTimeDownload.png){.zoom}

After extracting the archive, Windows users should run `SSDTTime.bat`, while Linux users will have to open their terminal, change directory to `SSDTTime`, and then run `python3 SSDTTime.py`.

::alert{type="warning"}
:icon{name="Warning"} If you're doing this on macOS for a different machine, you'll run these scripts by double-clicking the respective `.command` files.
::

::alert{type="info"}
:icon{name="Info"} It's assumed you already have Python installed from the last step.
::

Upon launching the tool, it will automatically download `iASL`, which (de)compiles ACPI tables. You should then be greeted with this:

Here we see that, at the time of writing, there are 11 options available:

::list{type="primary"}
- `FixHPET`

    Fixes `IRQ` (Interrupt Request) conflicts in the ACPI tables. These conflicts can cause some hardware like sound to not work properly.
- `FakeEC`

    Creates a fake Embedded Controller device for macOS to work properly __and__ disables the original EC.
- `FakeEC Laptop`

    Creates a fake Embedded Controller device for macOS to work properly, but __does not__ disable the original EC, because laptops need it for battery status, FN keys, etc.
- `USBX`

    Creates an USBX device which contains USB power properties necessary proper functionality. This also requires a valid EC device.
- `PluginType`

    It sets the `plugin-type` property to `1` on the first CPU core, enabling `X86PlatformPlugin`, which allows for (Intel) CPU Power Management and `AGPM` (Apple GPU Power Management). It also redefines the processors with `Processor` objects instead of `Device` objects if required, since macOS doesn't support the newer standard.
- `PMC`

    Defines the `PMCR` device on systems that don't have it to allow native `NVRAM` support.
- `RTCAWAC`

    Disables the new `AWAC` (Alarm Wake ACPI Clock) and enables the `RTC` (Real-Time Clock) instead.
- `USB Reset`

    Disables the `RHUB` devices in ACPI for all USB controllers to allow macOS to enumerate USB ports properly on borked ACPI systems. We will not use this since we will create an USB map.
- `PCI Bridge`

    macOS requires all devices that we inject properties into to have their PCI bridges defined, this is what this SSDT does, we will not use it for now.
- `PNLF`

    Creates a fake `PNLF` device with an user-selectable `_UID` (basically the profile it uses) to allow for native brightness control on laptops.
- `XOSI`

    Spoofs the operating system to Windows, allowing any peripherals locked behind non-macOS to be active on macOS.
::

::alert{type="info"}
:icon{name="Info"} Most of these patches will only apply on macOS and should not cause any side-effects on other operating systems
::

We will start with option `P`. It dumps the current system's `DSDT`, which will be utilised in order to create these `SSDT`s and patches.

All systems should choose:

::list{type="primary"}
- `FixHPET`

  Choose option `C` which only patches conflicting IRQs from legacy devices.
- `USBX`

  Choose the default option (`B` key).
- `RTCAWAC`

  Don't worry if it says you don't need it, just continue.
- `PluginType`
::

AMD desktops should choose, in addition

::list{type="primary"}
- `FakeEC`
::

AMD laptops should choose, in addition

::list{type="primary"}
- `FakeEC Laptop`
- `PNLF`
- `XOSI`

  Choose option 19 (for AMD systems)
::

Here's how the `Results` folder would look like after we're done

![SSDTTime Results](/Images/SSDTTimeResults.png){.zoom}

We will now copy all the files that start with `SSDT` and end in `.aml` inside of `Drive/EFI/OC/ACPI`.

Finally, we will merge `patches_OC.plist` by using the `PatchMerge` script included with `SSDTTime`. Run it the same way as `SSDTTime`.

Press `1` to select the `config.plist` created in an earlier step, then drag and drop your `config.plist` onto the window, and press enter.

The modified `config.plist` with the patches merged in will appear in the `Results` folder. Check that it's okay, then replace your copy with this one.

And that's it, we're done. Now, we need to [gather all the required kexts](/guide/gathering-files/kexts).
