# NootedRed

## Prerequisites

::list{type="warning"}
- Your system must not have a GCN 5 or RDNA AMD dGPU.
:::list{type="success"}
  - They can be disabled using the `-wegnoegpu` boot arg or the `disable-gpu` device property.
:::
::
::list{type="danger"}
- Increase VRAM size.
:::list{type="info"}
  - `512MiB` minimum, `1GiB+` for proper functionality.
:::
::
::list{type="danger"}
- Disable Legacy Boot, also known as CSM and Boot Mode.
:::list{type="info"}
  - Otherwise you will meet kernel panics like `Failed to get VBIOS from VRAM`.
:::
::
::list{type="danger"}
- Remove `WhateverGreen`.
:::list{type="info"}
  - NRed conflicts with it.
:::
::
::list{type="info"}
- Use `MacBookPro16,3`, `iMac20,1` or `iMacPro1,1` SMBIOS
:::list{type="warning"}
  - `MacPro7,1` might result in a black screen.
:::
::
::list{type="info"}
- Do your macOS updates (The minor ones, not necessary to go Big Sur -> Monterey)
::

## Backlight functionality

Usually only works on laptops.

::list
- [`SSDT-PNLF.aml`](Assets/SSDT-PNLF.aml)
- [`SSDT-ALS0.aml`](Assets/SSDT-ALS0.aml) if you have no Ambient Light Sensor
- [`SMCLightSensor.kext`](https://github.com/Acidanthera/VirtualSMC)
- [`BrightnessKeys.kext`](https://github.com/Acidanthera/BrightnessKeys) for keyboard brightness control (some vendors might require custom SMC kexts)

## Frequency Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)

### What happened with NRed? Why isn't there as much activity anymore?

It's alive, just with an overwhelmed developer; a project member was removed.

Currently I'm working on a more advanced reverse engineering script for Ghidra, to increase our productivity. It is currently private and confidential, but will eventually be released to the public. I'm also helping my two friends (and project members) expand their skillset (without spoon-feeding answers).

### My HDR-enabled display boots to a black screen with flashing backlight

Disable HDR either from the BIOS, a tool like `Smokeless-UMAF` or by connecting to the computer remotely and doing it from macOS' settings.

### My OLED display cannot have its brightness adjusted

As far as we know, the code in the AMD kexts simply cannot handle OLED displays. Use an app like Lunar.

### Chrome, Chromium-based browsers and apps like Sublime Text cause graphical artefacts amongst other problems

Known issue, but unknown cause.

For the browsers you can disable `GPU Rasterisation` inside `chrome://flags` as a workaround or just use Safari.

Anything else will likely require complete neutralisation of GPU/Hardware acceleration.

### Constant freezes and crashes on Ventura and newer

With the `RestrictEvents` kext you can put `revblock=media` in your boot args to reduce this to a minimal amount. The issue seems to be excessive usage of compute by various macOS services like image analysis.

Cause of the compute dysfunctionality spanning across all macOS versions remains unknown.
