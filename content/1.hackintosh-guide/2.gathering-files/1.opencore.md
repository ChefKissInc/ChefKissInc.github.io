# OpenCore

OpenCore is essentially a program that runs after the firmware (the BIOS/UEFI), which starts macOS.

Additionally, it has the ability to apply patches, add drivers, and spoof the device information.

For starters, we shall visit its GitHub repository, which is located [here](https://github.com/Acidanthera/OpenCorePkg){target="_blank"}.

Head to the release section. This is where the official released build artefacts are placed.

::alert{type="info"}
:icon{name="tabler:info-circle"} A build artefact is the end result of code after compilation, a process which turns the human-readable code into machine code, a language which is understood by computers.

The latest release is always located at the top. At the bottom of the release "card" reside the files associated with this release. You can see both RELEASE and DEBUG builds.

::alert{type="info"}
:icon{name="tabler:info-circle"} An optimised build, aka release build, is a build type where the code is optimised in the compilation process, speeding up execution and removing debugging information. In contrast, an unoptimised debug build contains more debugging information and logs, but is significantly slower than an optimised build. Use debug builds only when troubleshooting.
