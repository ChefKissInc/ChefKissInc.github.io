# Intro

The first step into getting a hackintosh working is gathering the required files. These files are required in order to boot macOS and for adding support to a variety of devices to it.

Don't forget that patience is key. Without the proper files, macOS will outright not boot, lack support for your peripherals, or have random issues overall.

We have split the file gathering process into multiple parts.

::list{type="primary"}
- [OpenCore](/hackintosh-guide/gathering-files/opencore), a key part to booting macOS,
- [ACPI](/hackintosh-guide/gathering-files/acpi), the required ACPI additions and patches,
- and [macOS Kexts](/hackintosh-guide/gathering-files/kexts), the variety of drivers required.
