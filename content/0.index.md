  WhateverRed NetDbg.
  #description
  NetDbg was a 100% Rust project used to send debug prints to a server from the kext via a simple TCP socket when iGPUs were stuck on black screens. [View it here](https://github.com/NootInc/WhateverRed-NETDBG){target="_blank"}

  Noot AMD Hackintosh Guide.
  #description
  Dortania guide, in our opinion, is convoluted and lacking up-to-date information here and there, and the styling of the site is meh. Additionally, their writers get easily burnt out. We decided to make our own guide, with up-to-date information, and avoiding duplicate -and potentially conflicting- information between pages. [View it here](/hackintosh-guide)

  Unofficial Lilu documentation.
  #description
  [Lilu](https://github.com/Acidanthera/Lilu){target="_blank"} is a library for hooking and patching kexts. It doesn't really have any documentation. We've decided to document it ourselves for everyone's convenience. Includes examples. [View it here](/lilu-docs)
