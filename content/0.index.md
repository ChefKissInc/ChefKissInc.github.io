  The Noot Hackintosh Guide
  #description
  Dortania guide was convoluted and was lacking up-to-date information here and there, the writers get easily burnt out, and the design of the UI is bad. We decided to make our own guide, with up-to-date information, and avoiding repeating shared information. [View it here](/guide)
