  Noot AMD Hackintosh Guide.
  #description
  Dortania guide, in our opinion, is convoluted and lacking up-to-date information here and there, and the styling of the site is meh. Additionally, their writers get easily burnt out. We decided to make our own guide, with up-to-date information, and avoiding repeating shared information. [View it here](/guide)
