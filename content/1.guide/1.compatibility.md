# Compatibility

MacOS has numerous hardware limitations due to the limited amount of hardware Apple supports, so we're limited by Apple and patches the community has created.

## CPU Support

AMD Bulldozer (15h) and newer CPUs are supported with the [AMD Vanilla](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla) patches.

::alert{type="warning"}
:icon{name="tabler:alert-triangle"} The patches are supported only since macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), older versions require a custom Kernel. This configuration is unsupported by this guide.
::

::alert{type="info"}
:icon{name="tabler:info-circle"} AMD Laptops CPUs are more or less the same as AMD Desktop CPUs
::

::alert{type="danger"}
:icon{name="tabler:alert-circle"} A few things in macOS don't work properly with an AMD CPU, see below
::

### CPU requirements

#### Architecture Requirements

::list{type="info"}
- x86_64/AMD64 (64-bit) CPUs are supported since Mac OS X 10.4.1
::

#### SSE Requirements

::list{type="info"}
- SSE3 is required for all Intel versions of Mac OS X/macOS
- SSSE3 is required for all 64-bit versions of Mac OS X/macOS
::
::list{type="warning"}
- SSE4 is required for macOS 10.12 up to, not including, 10.14
- macOS 10.14+, and newer AMD GPU drivers require SSE4.2. Avoid SSE4.1 CPUs if possible. May work with some hacks; see [Gathering Files > Kexts](/guide/gathering-files/kexts)
::

### AMD CPU incompatibilities

Unfortunately many features in macOS are unsupported with AMD, with many others being partially broken. These include:

#### Virtual Machines relying on AppleHV

::list{type="danger"}
- This includes VirtualBox, VMWare, Parallels, Docker, Android Studio, etc.
::
::list{type="info"}
- VirtualBox versions older than 7.0, VMware 10 and Parallels 13.1.0 do support their own hypervisor, however using such outdated VM software poses a large security threat
::

#### Adobe Support

::list{type="danger"}
- Most of Adobe's suite relies on Intel's Memfast instruction set, resulting in crashes with AMD CPUs
::
::list{type="info"}
- You can disable functionality like RAW support to avoid the crashing: [Adobe Fixes](https://gist.github.com/naveenkrdy/26760ac5135deed6d0bb8902f6ceb6bd)
::

#### 32-Bit support

::list{type="danger"}
- The AMD Vanilla patches do not support 32-bit instructions
::

#### Stability issues on many apps

::list{type="danger"}
- Audio-based apps are the most prone to issues, ie. Logic Pro.
- DaVinci Resolve has been known to have sporadic issues as well
::

## GPU Support

GPU support is much more complicated due to the near-infinite amount of graphics cards, but the general breakdown is as follows:

### AMD GPUs

::list{type="success"}
- [GCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Core_Next) and [RDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_(microarchitecture)) GPUs are supported in the latest versions of macOS
::
::list{type="danger"}
- RDNA 3 GPUs are unsupported
::
::list{type="success"}
- [Raven-based](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-raven.g816) (GCN 5, aka Vega10) AMD APUs are supported with WhateverRed
::
::list{type="danger"}
- [Renoir-based](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-renoir.g1058) (GCN 5.1, aka Vega20) AMD APUs are unsupported at the moment
- Other iGPU generations (GCN 1-4, RDNA) aren't supported at all either
::
::list{type="warning"}
- [Lexa-based](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-lexa.g806) (GCN 4, aka Polaris) are supported with a device ID spoof
::
Special note for MSI Navi users: [Installer not working with 5700XT #901](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/901), resolved since macOS 11 (Big Sur).

### NVIDIA GPUs

::list{type="warning"}
- Maxwell ([9XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_900_series)) and Pascal ([10XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_10_series)) GPUs are limited to macOS 10.13 (High Sierra)
::
::list{type="danger"}
- Turing ([20XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_20_series), [16XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_16_series)) GPUs aren't supported in any version of macOS
- Ampere ([30XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_30_series)) GPUs are not supported in any version of macOS
::
::list{type="warning"}
- Kepler ([6XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_600_series), [7XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_700_series)) GPUs are supported up to macOS 11 (Big Sur)
