# Compatibility

MacOS has numerous hardware limitations due to the limited amount of hardware Apple supports, so we're limited by Apple and patches the community has created.

## CPU Support

AMD Bulldozer (15h) and newer CPUs are supported with the [AMD Vanilla](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla) patches.

::alert{type="warning"}
:icon{name="ic:sharp-warning"} The patches are supported only since High Sierra, older versions require a custom Kernel. This configuration is unsupported by this guide.
::

::alert{type="info"}
:icon{name="ic:sharp-info"} AMD Laptops CPUs are more or less the same as AMD Desktop CPUs
::

::alert{type="danger"}
:icon{name="ic:sharp-error"} A few things in macOS don't work properly with an AMD CPU, see below

Architecture Requirements

::list{type="info"}
- x86_64/AMD64 (64-bit) CPUs are supported since Mac OS X 10.4.1
::

SSE Requirements

::list{type="info"}
- SSE3 is required for all Intel versions of Mac OS X/macOS
- SSSE3 is required for all 64-bit versions of Mac OS X/macOS
::
::list{type="warning"}
- SSE4 is required for macOS 10.12 up to, not including, 10.14
- macOS 10.14+, and newer AMD GPU drivers require SSE4.2. Avoid SSE4.1 CPUs if possible. May work with some hacks; see [Gathering Files > Kexts](/guide/gathering-files/kexts)
