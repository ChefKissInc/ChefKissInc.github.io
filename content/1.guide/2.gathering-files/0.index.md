The first step into getting a hackintosh working is gathering the required files. These files are required in order to boot macOS, and for adding support for a variety of devices to it.

Patience is key; without the proper files, macOS will outright not boot, lack support for a few of your peripherals, or have random issues overall. Don't forget this!

We have split the file gathering process into multiple parts.

- [OpenCore](/guide/gathering-files/opencore), the bootloader itself,
- [SSDTs](/guide/gathering-files/ssdts), the required ACPI additions and patches,
- and [Kexts](/guide/gathering-files/kexts), the variety of drivers required.
