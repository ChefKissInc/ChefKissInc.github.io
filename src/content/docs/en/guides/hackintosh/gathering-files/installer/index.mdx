There are two types of macOS installers

- [Online](/en/guides/hackintosh/gathering-files/installer/online), this method uses the basic recovery macOS environment called `recoveryOS`. It downloads the OS files from Apple's servers at install time, which requires a stable internet connection. This method can be done on basically any OS.
- Offline <Badge text="TODO" variant="note"/>, this method downloads the full macOS installer, which requires no internet connection at install time.
