Welcome to the ChefKiss Hackintosh Guide.

This guide will accompany you through the process of installing macOS on your PC.

<Aside type="tip">
A Hackintosh is a computer running macOS on a non-Apple system. Wowza!

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
    <Card icon="ph:clock-clockwise-duotone" title="Time and patience">
    Creating a Hackintosh is a relatively lengthy process. No steps can be skipped. Don't start working on this if you have other things to do. Hackintoshes generally are __not__ something you should be relying on as a work machine.
    </Card>
    <Card icon="ph:plugs-connected-duotone" title="A compatible system">
    Your CPU, GPU, motherboard, Ethernet card, Wi-Fi card, and others are important for whether your machine can run macOS: Unlike Windows and Linux, macOS isn't compatible with every x86 PC; There's still a significant amount of unsupported hardware, albeit several efforts.
    </Card>
    <Card icon="ph:terminal-window-duotone" title="Basic command line knowledge">
    Essential for going through the steps of the guide. Can't help you with how to change working directory in cmd.
    </Card>
    <Card icon="ph:usb-duotone" title="A large enough USB drive">
    You need a minimum of 16GiB to create an offline recovery USB drive (macOS only), and 2GiB if you're making an online recovery USB drive (cross-platform).
    </Card>
    <Card icon="ph:network-duotone" title="A compatible networking card">
    If you're using online recovery. Like mentioned before, macOS is not compatible with all hardware, so you can't just have any networking card.
    </Card>
    <Card icon="ph:computer-tower-duotone" title="A working computer">
    You need something to run all the scripts and tools in order to make the USB drive with all required files.
    </Card>
    <Card icon="ph:seal-check-duotone" title="Up-to-date firmware">
    MacOS is very nitpicky; if your hardware has any significant "non-standard" or "unexpected" behaviour or bug, it will not work.
