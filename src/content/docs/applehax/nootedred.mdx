## iGPU compatibility

The entire Vega Raven ASIC family (`Ryzen 1xxx (Athlon Silver/Gold)` to `5xxx`, and `7x30` series).

## macOS compatibility

NootedRed is compatible with `macOS 10.15` up to `macOS 26`.

It's not possible to go below `macOS 10.15` as the iGPU logic and `rDNA` code (used for `DCN` and `VCN`) were introduced in that version.

## Prerequisites

- An OpenCore EFI configured according to our guide.
- Your system must not have a `GCN 5` or `rDNA` AMD dGPU.
  - They can be disabled using the `-wegnoegpu` boot arg or the `disable-gpu` device property.
- Increase VRAM size.
  - `512MiB` minimum, `1GiB+` for proper functionality.
- Remove `WhateverGreen.kext` or `NootRX.kext`.
  - This kext conflicts with them.
- Use `MacBookPro16,2`, `iMac20,1` or `iMacPro1,1` SMBIOS.
  - `MacPro7,1` might result in a black screen.
- Do your macOS updates (the minor ones, not necessary to go from e.g. `macOS 11` to `macOS 12`).

## Backlight functionality

Usually only works on laptops.

- [`SSDT-PNLF.aml`](/Extras/SSDTs/SSDT-PNLF.aml)
- [`SSDT-ALS0.aml`](/Extras/SSDTs/SSDT-ALS0.aml) if you have no Ambient Light Sensor
- [`SMCLightSensor.kext`](https://github.com/Acidanthera/VirtualSMC)
- [`BrightnessKeys.kext`](https://github.com/Acidanthera/BrightnessKeys) for keyboard brightness control (some vendors might require custom SMC kexts)

## Frequently asked questions

<Aside type="danger">
This list is not exhaustive, for more information you should check the [issues](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/NootedRed/issues), potentially also the discussions.
</Aside>

### What happened to the commit history? Weren't there like a thousand commits before, spanning across several years?

A "controversy" with two ex-team-members. They didn't contribute much to the project and it was deemed that they should not gain publicity from it.

### I get stuck on a black screen or restart after black screen on Catalina

Update the kext. If still getting a black screen right before the Setup Assistant, force restart and it should fix itself.

### My external display's audio appears, but no audio comes out of it

Known issue. We don't know the problem yet; it works on most systems. You'll have to be patient for now (again).

### My HDR-enabled display boots to a black screen with flashing backlight

Disable HDR either from the BIOS, a tool like `Smokeless-UMAF` or by connecting to the computer remotely and doing it from macOS' settings.

### My OLED display cannot have its brightness adjusted

Update the kext, some code has been added to support this. If still not working, please contact us on Telegram.

### Chrome, Chromium-based browsers and apps like Sublime Text cause graphical artefacts amongst other problems

Known issue, unknown cause.

For the browsers you can disable `GPU Rasterisation` inside `chrome://flags` as a workaround or just use Safari.

Anything else will likely require disabling GPU/Hardware acceleration.

If you can't even open the (chromium-based) browser because of the issue, you can launch it like in the following terminal command

```sh
open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-gpu
```

### Constant freezes and crashes on Sonoma

Cause of the compute dysfunctionality remains unknown. Latest commit should have minimal issues, as long as you have a static image as your background and no Memoji as the account avatar.
