<Aside type="tip">
`Advanced Configuration and Power Interface` (ACPI) is an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components, perform power management (e.g. powering off a USB controller), auto configuration (e.g. Plug and Play, hot swapping) and status monitoring.

Manufacturers can make operating system checks, which is usually done to disable some devices and other functionality on OSes they don't intend to support.

The main ACPI table is the `DSDT` (Differentiated System Description Table), defining most of the devices. Then there's the `SSDT`s (Secondary System Description Tables), adding extra properties (e.g. the `_PRW` (Power Resources for Wake) method), extra devices, disabling some devices based on a condition, etc.

Most firmware define the devices in the `DSDT` and use some `SSDT`s to adjust values depending on the installed hardware and/or BIOS settings. If you're interested in ACPI, you can read the ACPI Specification listed in the [UEFI Forum specifications](https://uefi.org/specifications).

## Downloading SSDTTime

<Aside type="note" title="Did you know?">
In the past these SSDTs had to be written manually but now there are automated tools for this process. [`SSDTTime`](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime) will be used by this guide.
</Aside>

Since `SSDTTime` does not have any releases and it's a Python project, download the source code instead by clicking on `Code` then `Download ZIP`.

## Running SSDTTime

After extracting the archive, Windows users should run `SSDTTime.bat`.

Linux users will have to open their terminal inside the extracted `SSDTTime`/`SSDTTime-master` directory then run `python3 SSDTTime.py`. **Make sure you have Python 3 installed.**

macOS users should run `SSDTTime.command`.

Upon launching the tool, it will automatically download `iASL`, which (de)compiles ACPI tables. You should then be greeted with the following screen.

![SSDTTime console](~/assets/SSDTTimeConsole.png)

### Specifying the target system's ACPI

Select option `P` on the target system to dump the ACPI tables needed for `SSDTTime`'s operations.

If you're not running `SSDTTime` on the target system, select `D` instead to pick the folder with the ACPI tables dumped from that target machine.

The software should now show the loaded ACPI tables at the top like in the screenshot below.

### Generating the SSDTs

<Aside type="note">
Most of these patches will only apply on macOS and should not cause any side-effects on other operating systems
</Aside>

<details>
<summary>Info about the options</summary>

At the time of writing, there are 12 options available

- `FixHPET`

  Fixes `IRQ` (Interrupt Request) conflicts in the ACPI tables. These conflicts can cause some hardware like sound to not work properly.

  <Aside type="danger">
  Do not use this option on AMD, as it may cause more harm than good (trackpad not working, etc).
  </Aside>

- `FakeEC`

  Creates a fake Embedded Controller device for macOS to work properly **and** disables the original EC.

- `FakeEC Laptop`

  Creates a fake Embedded Controller device for macOS to work properly, but **does not** disable the original EC, because laptops need it for battery status, FN keys, etc.

- `USBX`

  Creates an USBX device which contains USB power properties necessary for proper functionality. This also requires a valid EC device.

- `PluginType`

  Sets the `plugin-type` property to `1` on the first CPU core, enabling `X86PlatformPlugin`, which allows for CPU and GPU power management (support varies).
  It also redefines the processors with `Processor` objects instead of `Device` objects if required, since macOS doesn't support the newer standard.

- `PMC`

  Defines the `PMCR` device on systems that don't have it to allow native `NVRAM` support.

- `RTCAWAC`

  Disables the new `AWAC` (Alarm Wake ACPI Clock) and enables the `RTC` (Real-Time Clock) instead.

- `USB Reset`

  Disables the `RHUB` devices in ACPI for all USB controllers to allow macOS to enumerate USB ports properly on borked ACPI systems.

- `PCI Bridge`

  Defines the PCI bridges for a device path specified as some devices might not have their PCI bridges defined which will make OpenCore unable to inject properties using the `DeviceProperties` key in the configuration.

- `PNLF`

  Creates a fake `PNLF` device with an user-selectable `_UID` (basically the profile it uses) to allow for native brightness control on laptops.

  <Aside type="danger">
  At a first glance it may appear as if it supports AMD laptops, but it is not the same as the one in the [NootedRed](/applehax/nootedred/) page.
  Use the one in the aforementioned page instead.
  </Aside>

- `XOSI`

  Spoofs the operating system to Windows, allowing any peripherals locked behind non-macOS to be active on macOS.

- `Fix DMAR`

  Removes Reserved Memory Regions from the `DMAR` table. It is required to get some devices like Intel I225-based ethernet controllers on Intel systems.

  <Aside type="danger">
  If you are already using macOS 12.2.1 and below and an Intel I225-based ethernet controller, you will need to remove `e1000=0` or `dk.e1000=0` from your boot args after doing this.
  </Aside>

**_All_** systems must choose the below

- `USBX`,

  Choose the **default** option (`B` key).

- `RTCAWAC`,

  If it says you don't need it, skip this SSDT.

- `PluginType`,
- and `USB Reset`.

AMD **_desktops_** must **also** choose the following

- `FakeEC`.

AMD **_laptops_** must **also** choose the following

- `FakeEC Laptop`,
- `XOSI`,

  Choose **default** (`A` key)

- and any backlight-related SSDTs required in the [NootedRed](/applehax/nootedred/) page.

## Copying the AML files from the Results folder

The `Results` folder will look similar to the below after you're done.

![SSDTTime Results](~/assets/SSDTTimeResults.png)

Now, copy all the files that start with `SSDT` and end in `.aml` inside of the root of the `Results` folder to `Drive/EFI/OC/ACPI`.

### Merging the OC patches using PatchMerge

Finally, merge `patches_OC.plist` by using the `PatchMerge` script included with `SSDTTime`. Run it the same way as `SSDTTime`.

![PatchMerge](~/assets/PatchMerge.png)

Press `1` to select the `Config.plist` created in an earlier step, then drag and drop your `Config.plist` onto the window, and press enter.

![PatchMerge after selecting the `Config.plist`](~/assets/PatchMerge_AfterSelect.png)

Afterwards, press `2` to start the merging process.

![PatchMerge after running the merge process](~/assets/PatchMerge_Result.png)

The modified `Config.plist` with the patches merged in will appear in the `Results` folder.

Check that it's okay, then replace your original `Config.plist` with the newly generated one.
