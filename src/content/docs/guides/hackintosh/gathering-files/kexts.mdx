title: Kexts
description: The selection of macOS kernel extensions for Hackintoshes.
---

import Aside from '~/components/Aside.astro';

macOS kernel drivers. OpenCore can inject or block drivers. You put them in `EFI/OC/Kexts`, but they also have to be specified in the `Config.plist`. We will take care of the latter at a later step.

<Aside type="tip" title="Did you know?">
Kext stands for Kernel EXTension. Wowie!
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
On macOS, kexts appear as a special file type with a bleach-white lego piece as the icon.

On other operating systems, kexts appear as plain folders that end in `.kext`.
</Aside>

  Provides patches for Intel iGPUs and for AMD and NVIDIA dGPUs to allow for graphical acceleration, frame-buffer patching, backlight control, etc.
  Do not combine with the other aforementioned graphics kexts.

## Audio

</Aside>

## Wi-Fi/Bluetooth

- [`Itlwm`](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm) (10.13+)

  Supports most Intel Wi-Fi cards. `AirportItlwm` uses macOS' Wi-Fi stack, and `Itlwm` uses [`Heliport`](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/HeliPort) to connect to networks.

- [`IntelBluetoothFirmware`](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware)

  Supports most Intel Wi-Fi cards. On macOS 11 and lower you need to use all 3 included kexts.

  <Aside type="note">
  On macOS 12+ you need to use `IntelBluetoothFirmware` and `IntelBTPatcher` from the aforementioned, and `BlueToolFixup` from [`BrcmPatchRAM`](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM).
  </Aside>

- [`AirportBrcmFixup`](https://github.com/acidanthera/AirportBrcmFixup)

  Patches the AirPort kexts to allow non-native Broadcom cards to use the native Wi-Fi stack.

- [`BrcmPatchRAM`](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM)

  Patches the Bluetooth stack to allow non-native Broadcom (and all other ones in macOS 12+ with `BlueToolFixup`) to use the native Bluetooth stack.

<Aside type="tip">
If your Wi-Fi card is unsupported and you don't have Ethernet, you can use [`HoRNDIS`](/Extras/Kexts/HoRNDIS.zip) to enable Android USB tethering. iPhone USB tethering doesn't work in `recoveryOS`.
</Aside>

## USB

- [`XLNCUSBFix`](/Extras/Kexts/XLNCUSBFix.zip) (10.13+)

- [`USBToolBox`](https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool)

  USB mapping tool. Works best on Windows.

  <Aside type="note">
  Enable "Use Native Classes" in settings and don't use the `USBToolBox` kext.
  It will prompt for your chosen SMBIOS when building, so save this as the last step.
  </Aside>

- [`USBMap`](https://github.com/CorpNewt/USBMap)

  USB mapping tool. Works only in macOS.

## Input

- [`VoodooPS2`](https://github.com/acidanthera/VoodooPS2) (10.11+)

  <summary>Satellites</summary>

  <Aside type="danger">
  You cannot figure out the device type from just branding or display name.
  </Aside>
  <Aside type="danger">
  You should use only one satellite, do not put them all together; they might conflict.
  </Aside>

  | Device type               | Satellite                                                                     |

  <Aside type="tip">
  HID is a very common device type. If you're on an AMD laptop, it is highly likely that your touchpad is wired through it. Still, double check.
  </Aside>
  </details>

- [`VoodooSMBus`](https://github.com/VoodooSMBus/VoodooSMBus) (10.14+)

  For input devices wired through the SMBus controller (I2C-i801) and also some peculiar ELAN SMBus input devices.

- [`ECEnabler`](https://github.com/1Revenger1/ECEnabler) (10.7+)

  Allows macOS to read EC fields over 8 bits long, removing the need to split them manually. Do **not** use on desktops. Necessary for laptop battery status to work properly.

- [`BrightnessKeys`](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrightnessKeys) (10.11+)

  Provides support for ACPI brightness change notifications (which usually come from your keyboard's function (FN) keys).
