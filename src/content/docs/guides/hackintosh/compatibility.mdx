macOS hardware support is limited to what Apple supports and community-created patches.

## CPU support

`AMD Bulldozer (15h)` and newer CPUs are supported with the [AMD Vanilla](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla) patches.

<Aside type="caution">
The patches support only `macOS 10.13` and newer, older versions require a custom kernel, which is unsupported by this guide.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
AMD Laptop CPUs are the same as AMD Desktop CPUs.
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
A few things in macOS don't work properly with an AMD CPU, see [below](#amd-cpu-incompatibilities).
</Aside>

### CPU requirements

#### Architecture requirements

- x86_64/AMD64 (64-bit) CPUs are supported since Mac OS X 10.4.1

#### SSE requirements

- `SSE3` is required for all Intel versions of macOS
- `SSSE3` is required for all 64-bit versions of macOS
- `SSE4` is required for `macOS 10.12` up to, not including, `macOS 10.14`
- `SSE4.2` is required for `macOS 10.14`+ and newer AMD GPU drivers. Avoid `SSE4.1`-only CPUs if possible. May work with some hacks; see [Gathering Files > Kexts](/guides/hackintosh/gathering-files/kexts)

### AMD CPU incompatibilities

Unfortunately, some things in macOS are broken on AMD systems.

#### Virtual Machines that utilise AppleHV

Known broken

- VirtualBox newer than 6
- VMWare newer than 10
- Parallels newer than 13.1
- Docker
- Android Studio
- QEMU's hvf accelerator backend

<Aside type="danger">
Outdated virtualisation software is a large security threat.
</Aside>

#### Compatibility issues with apps using Intel MKL

Apps utilising Intel MKL will require a patch from a tool such as [`AMDHelper`](https://github.com/alvindimas05/AMDHelper).

Intel seems to be sabotaging AMD CPUs by making MKL not work on them.

Known apps utilising Intel MKL

- Krisp
- Logic Pro Waves Plug-In
- Adobe software
- Discord

#### 32-bit apps

The `AMD Vanilla` patches don't support 32-bit apps, even in `WINE`/`CrossOver`. However, it somehow works on Threadripper (TRX40).

## GPU support

GPU support is complicated.

### AMD GPUs

- [GCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Core_Next) and [RDNA](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_(microarchitecture)>) GPUs are supported in the latest versions of macOS.
- RDNA 3 GPUs are unsupported, Navi 24 is also not supported (yet). Navi 22 is supported by [`NootRX`](/applehax/nootrx)
- [Raven](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-raven.g816) and [Renoir](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-renoir.g1058) AMD iGPUs are supported via [`NootedRed`](/applehax/nootedred).
- Other iGPU generations (GCN \<5, RDNA) are **not** supported at all (yet).
- [Baffin](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-baffin.g796) AMD dGPUs are supported in the latest version of macOS.
- [Ellesmere](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-ellesmere.g795) AMD dGPUs are supported in the latest version of macOS.
- [Lexa](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-lexa.g806) AMD dGPUs are supported via device ID spoof to the respective Baffin variant.
- Polaris 20 AMD dGPUs are not supported (yet).

<Aside type="danger">
**MSI Navi** users: [Installer not working with 5700XT #901](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/901), **resolved since `macOS 11`**.
</Aside>

### NVIDIA GPUs

- Maxwell ([9XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_900_series)) and Pascal ([10XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_10_series)) GPUs are **limited** to **`macOS 10.13`**.
- Turing ([20XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_20_series), [16XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_16_series)) GPUs are **not** supported in any version of macOS.
- Ampere ([30XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_30_series)) GPUs are **not** supported in any version of macOS.
- Kepler ([6XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_600_series), [7XX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_700_series)) GPUs are supported up to **`macOS 11`**.

With that out of the way, let's start with [gathering the required files](/guides/hackintosh/gathering-files).
