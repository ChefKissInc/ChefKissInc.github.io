I've noticed a lot of users complaining that AppleALC is not working on an AMD system using macOS Sequoia.

I took a look at the patches and noticed that they don't apply anymore.

Unfortunately, a proper fix for those specific patches is not possible because the compiler was updated and there is no space for one of them.

So, with this build, any controller vendor ID is now valid. This may cause unintended side-effects.

It should be enough until it's either properly fixed or IntergalacticAudio is released.

Don't ask me for the source code, I don't have it anymore; I just went in, searched for the patches in Binary Ninja, fixed what I could, made a build, then deleted the code.

I hope it helps you.
